/*
    This library includes an adaptive psychophysics methods called PEST
    (Parameter Estimation by Sequential Testing).
    
    The description will be in terms of stimulus differences
    for a Yes-No experiment. The forced-choice equivalent 
    substitutes "correct" for "yes" and "incorrect" for "no."
    There are 6 rules in this methods:

    1. On every reversal of step direction, halve the step size.
    2. The second step in a given direction, if called for, is
    the same size as the first.
    The size of the initial stimulus difference is set to a 
    constant multiplied by the exit criterion. 
    In order that a decision can be made to the
    response following the first stimulus presentation, it
    is necessary to assume the step size and the direction
    for two (imaginary) presentations prior to the first
    actual stimulus presentation.


    3. The fourth and subsequent steps in a given direction
    are each double their predecessor (except that, as
    noted above, large steps may be disturbing to a human
    observer and an upper limit on permissible step size
    may be needed).
    4. Whether a third successive step in a given direction
    is the same as or double the second depends on the sequence
    of steps leading to the most recent reversal. If
    the step immediately preceding that reversal resulted
    from a doubling, then the third step is not doubled,
    while if the step leading to the most recent reversal was
    not the result of a doubling, then this third step is
    double the second. 


    
    5. Exit rule. If the step size upon the next trial
    is less than an arbitrary pre-set exit criterion, the
    trial is terminated. The value of the stimulus on the
    next trial is the point estimate of its threshold.
    6. Maximum rule. The maximum size step is
    limited to a constant multiplied by the exit criterion.
    7. "Bumping into zero" rule. If the step size will
    modify the size of the stimulus difference to a difference
    below zero, the step size is successively halved
